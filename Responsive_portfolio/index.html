            <h3>Frontend Developer</h3>
            <p>"Hello, I'm Agrim Gupta and I'm a frontend developer. My passion for web development started when I was in 2nd year of college and I've been honing my skills ever since.

                As a frontend developer, I'm always striving to create intuitive, user-friendly interfaces that are both aesthetically pleasing and functional. I love working with modern web technologies and frameworks such as React, Angular, and Vue.js to build responsive and interactive web applications.
                
                One of the things that sets me apart as a frontend developer is my attention to detail. I believe that every pixel and every line of code counts, and I'm dedicated to crafting interfaces that look and feel polished. I'm also passionate about user experience (UX) design and enjoy collaborating with designers to create interfaces that are optimized for usability and accessibility.
                
                In my previous roles, I've worked on a variety of projects ranging from small-scale landing pages to complex web applications. Some of my favorite projects have involved implementing animations and visual effects to create engaging user experiences.
                
                When I'm not coding, I enjoy keeping up with the latest frontend development trends by attending conferences and reading blogs. I'm also an avid hiker and enjoy spending time in the great outdoors.
                
                Overall, I'm excited about the future of frontend development and look forward to continuing to grow and improve my skills as a frontend developer."
